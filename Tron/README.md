# Tron

A game based perhaps on [this](https://www.twoplayergames.org/Tron/221.html)
Flash game. It's a multiplayer Snake-esque game, except the snake's tail never
disappears; it stays in place while the "snake" gets longer. The goal is to
maneuvre other players to crash into one of the "snakes".

I remember writing this game because the Flash original only supported two
players, and I wanted to play the game with more of my classmates at once.
