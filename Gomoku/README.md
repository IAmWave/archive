# Gomoku

First, the original README.TXT:

```
This program plays Gomoku, also known as Five-in-a-row. It evaluates each field based on the lines it can create for both players. The program detects forks and forced turns (blocking the opponent).
Since the GUI was primarily meant for my testing and I have abandoned the project (perhaps temporarily), the board resets instantly after a win for one player. I believe it is clear enough when which side won.

Controls:
Click the field you want to make your move to.
V toggles the visualisation of field values.
N makes the computer finish the match instantly by playing against itself.
B does the same, but slower. You can press B again during the battle to pause it.
```

It is my second attempt (after `Piskvorky`) at a Gomoku/Pi≈°kvorky/Five-in-a-row AI. Although there is a `Minimax` subfolder, I don't think I completed the Minimax-based AI. The other ones, BlockAI and ForkAI, are complete.

The timestamps of files are between August 2013 and November 2014, so it seems I returned to the project a couple of times.
